    What you need to know:
    <ul>
        <li>Refunding third-party items from Amazon will still count towards the amount of refunds done on the account.</li>
        <li>It is normal to receive an OFM email from Amazon as that's just a warning.</li>
        <li>Signature and delivered orders with photos does not matter.</li>
        <li>You can refund with fresh/new Amazon accounts, an aged one is no longer necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    I recommend buying from sellers with 1,000+ overall ratings and that do not mention "ship it yourself" in their return policy. Here's a list of sellers that's not doable:
    <ul>
        <li>Adorama</li>
        <li>rlracingperformance</li>
        <li>Shopbop | East Dane</li>
        <li>DataVision Computer Video</li>
        <li>Spreetail</li>
        <li>UTech Global (Fast Shipping)</li>
        <li>Expercom - Apple Premier Partner</li>
        <li>Stadium Goods</li>
        <li>The list will be updated over time.</li>
    </ul>
    The fee will be 30%. Pay on refund confirmation!
